# Lemonade-Stand

Lemonade-Stand is a simple game designed to improve my Ruby skills.

#How it Works:

Start of day
You start the game with $5, 0 lemons, 0 sugar, and 0 cups of lemonade
While the user has funds you can buy lemons and sugar
The user can make some cups of lemonade (user decides how many) - 1 sugar and 1 lemon to make
The user then sets price for lemonade

Day plays out
Temperature for day is generated (relative to previous day)
Number of people who walk by stand is based on Temperature
Number of cups sold is based on people + price
Any cups not sold are discarded

End of Day
Show profit/loss
